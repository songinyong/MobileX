This practice page is provided as an additional resource in case example3 is not functioning properly. 

However, if you still wish to proceed with example3, you are to do so.

In this practice, we will provide more detailed instructions and code for using models deployed on Triton Server, 


Furthermore, in this practice, we will provide a more detailed example code for preprocessing data according to the config.pbtxt file before deploying a model. 

We will also provide an example code for implementing a service that uses multiple models simultaneously, which participants can run and experiment with.
