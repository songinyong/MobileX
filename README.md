MobileX 자료 만드는 레포입니다

The Mobile X Cluster practice consists of the following steps:


1. Installing LLM on a local NUC PC
2. Demonstration of an inference service using Triton Server
3. Demonstration of a chatbot service using LLM deployed on Triton Server.

By completing these steps, participants can gain hands-on experience with serving AI models using Triton Server.
As mentioned in the presentation, the Mobile X Cluster was built by applying various technologies discussed in Smart X. By participating in this practice, you will have the opportunity to apply the skills you have learned so far to manage the latest infrastructure and build services.
